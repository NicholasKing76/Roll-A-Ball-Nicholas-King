# Roll A Ball Nicholas King
 Assignment 5

1. I added an Intro scene with instructions on how to play the game and an exit scene with buttons to exit or to play again.

2. I added an input field on the Intro scene that would show the user's name on all scenes.

3. I added a dropdown menu to let the user pick how many rounds they want to play.

4. I added sliders on the Intro scene that allows the user to change the speed of the ball and the rotation speed of the cubes. These are
displayed on the game scene as well.

5. I added a score on the game scene.

6. The score of the last played game and high score are displayed on the exit scene.

7. I added a way to keep track of the high score.

8. I added a sound effect that plays when a cube is picked up.
